<h3>Overview</h3>
When reporting an issue to SonicBase, you need to include a diangostics file. This is a file that contains
information about your cluster to help with debugging.<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Gathering Diagnostics</h3>
To gather diagnostics, in the SonicBase client, type "gather diagnostics". This will collect all the information
on the local machine. For Linux and Mac, a tarball file is created at the location printed in the client. For
Windows, the user needs to zip the contents of the {installDir}/tmp directory.<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Sending the Diagnostics File</h3>
<div class="mylink">
After the tarball or zip file is created, send it to SonicBase <a href="mailto:support@sonicbase.com">Support</a>
with a list of the queries you were doing at the time the problem occurred.
