<div class="mylink">
Before you connect to the database you need to create the database using the client. See the
<a class="mylink" href="getting-started.html">Getting Started Guide</a> for an example.<br/>
    <br/>
    You must also include the SonicBase jdbc driver jar in your classpath. The jar is located
    int the "lib" directory of the install directory. It is named "sonicbase-[version].jar".
