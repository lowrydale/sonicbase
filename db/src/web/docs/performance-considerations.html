<h2>Prepared Statements</h2>
It is important that you use a parameterized prepared statement. You should not use contstants for parameters
that change frequently. Using parameters allows SonicBased to optimize and reuse the query.<br/>

<h2>Bulk Loading</h2>
When bulk loading you should have many clients with up to sixteen threads per client all doing batch inserts.
The source records should be divided evenly by primary key range across all the clients. In our testing
we used twice as many clients as servers and the clients had half the cores.<br/>

<h2>Machine Size</h2>
A pretty optimal size of machine is one that has 60gig of ram. Larger machines have a tendency to have
larger garbage collection times. If you are still having gc problems with 60gig, try using more and smaller
machines. If you can't go smaller, try running two servers on each machine with half the java heap. Make sure you
give them different ports.

<h2>Identity Reads</h2>
When reading by identity, a cluster of reads should read records close to each other according to field
in the where clause. This will cause all reads in the cluster to go to the same shard, which enhances performance.

<h2>Startup Performance</h2>
Starting a cluster that is loaded with data can be slow. The server must read every record from disk
and load it into memory. An optimized disk will speed up server start time. If you need fast startup, it is
recommended that you have an SSD disk with 5k iops.
