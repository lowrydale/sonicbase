<h3>PowerShell</h3>
Powershell scripting must be enabled. Also, remote powershell commands must be enabled. To
enable these features open a powershell session on the server and on the client as an administrator
and type the following:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Enable-PSRemoting -Force<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Credentials</h3>
When you connect to a cluster for the first time, SonicBase will ask you for credentials for
your servers. These credentials are stored in an encrypted file on the client and are subsequently
used when interacting with the servers.
