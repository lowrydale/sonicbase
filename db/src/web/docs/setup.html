<h3>JDK Requirements</h3>
The jvm running the database server needs to be at least version 7.
<br/>

<h3>Server Memory Size</h3>
Size the server memory at approximately 2x the records size for small records (150 bytes).
Allocate a slightly less percentage for larger records.
<br/>

<h3>Disk Size</h3>
Size the disk at 3x the server memory size plus enough for disk-based result sets (perhaps another 3x).
<br/>

<h3>Disk Optimization</h3>
An optimized disk will speed up server start time. It is recommended that you have an SSD disk with 5k iops.
<br/>

<h3>Config File</h3>
You must create a config file for your cluster. See <a href="config.html">config</a> for details.
