<h3>Python Requirements</h3>

<h3>Operating System Requirements</h3>
SonicBase only runs on Linux and Mac OS X.

<h3>Server Memory Size</h3>
Size the server memory at approximately 2x the records size for small records (150 bytes).
Allocate a slightly less percentage for larger records.
<br/>

<h3>Disk Size</h3>
Size the disk at 3x the server memory size plus enough for disk-based result sets (perhaps another 3x).
<br/>

<br/>

<h3>Port Access</h3>
The servers must be able to communicate with one another on the configured ports in the config file. Also,
the client needs to communicate with each server on the configured ports. If you don't want access to these
port outside a firewall, move the client inside the firewall and run it from there.

There must be passwordless ssh access between all the servers and between the client and all the servers.
If you don't want ssh access to the servers outside a firewall, move the client inside the firewall and run
