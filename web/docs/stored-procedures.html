<h1>Stored Procedures</h1>

        Stored procedures allow you to embed code in the SonicBase database for manipulating queries and result sets. Stored
        procedures are written in Java. The stored procedure "execute" method is invoked on one replica of every shard. Additionally, there is
        an "init" and "finalize" method that are called once on a random server in the cluster. The init is called on the same server
        as the finalize. Inside the stored procedure you have access to a database connection, which allows
        you to perform any query on the database. This connection also has the ability to allow you to restrict queries
        to the server it is running on. This is important for performance. This allows you to traverse the database
        without going off-box which would incur communication penalties.
        <br/><br/>
        With this database connection you can provide a "RecordEvaluator" class that will be called on every record that
        meets your query criteria. You can indicate the record should be included in the results by returning "true" from your
        RecordEvaluator. Or you can return "false" to not include the record in the results. Additionally, you can do whatever
        you want with the record, like insert it into another table. Note that the query you issue in your stored procedure
        should narrow the results as much as possible so you aren't just doing a table scan.
        <br/><br/>
        There are a couple of different ways to handle results returned to the client. If you have a large results set
        you need to store the results in a temporary table and allow the client to traverse that table to get the results. If
        you have a small results set(less than 50k results) you can directly return the results to the client.
        <br/><br/>
        On the client, you pass in a sql statement of the form "call procedure '[class_name]', [parm1], [parm2],...". The
        parameters are available on the server in the StoredProcedureContext passed into the stored procedure.
        <br/><br/>
        You must place the jar containing your stored procedure in the sonicbase/lib directory and deploy it across the cluster. It is
        highly recommended that you throroughly test your stored procedure on a small cluster that you can quickly
        restart and reload your class.
